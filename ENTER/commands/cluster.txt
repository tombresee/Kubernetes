\CoreDNS is running at https://kubernetes.docker.internal:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

What is a Kubernetes cluster?

A Kubernetes cluster is a set of nodes that run containerized applications. Containerizing applications packages an app with its dependences and some necessary services. They are more lightweight and flexible than virtual machines. In this way, Kubernetes clusters allow for applications to be more easily developed, moved and managed. 

Kubernetes clusters allow containers to run across multiple machines and environments: virtual, physical, cloud-based, and on-premises. Kubernetes containers are not restricted to a specific operating system, unlike virtual machines. Instead, they are able to share operating systems and run anywhere.

Kubernetes clusters are comprised of one master node and a number of worker nodes. These nodes can either be physical computers or virtual machines, depending on the cluster.

The master node controls the state of the cluster; for example, which applications are running and their corresponding container images. The master node is the origin for all task assignments. It coordinates processes such as:

Scheduling and scaling applications
Maintaining a cluster’s state
Implementing updates
The worker nodes are the components that run these applications. Worker nodes perform tasks assigned by the master node. They can either be virtual machines or physical computers, all operating as part of one system.

There must be a minimum of one master node and one worker node for a Kubernetes cluster to be operational. For production and staging, the cluster is distributed across multiple worker nodes. For testing, the components can all run on the same physical or virtual node.

A namespace is a way for a Kubernetes user to organize many different clusters within just one physical cluster. Namespaces enable users to divide cluster resources within the physical cluster among different teams via resource quotas. For this reason, they are ideal in situations involving complex projects or multiple teams. 






What makes up a Kubernetes cluster?

A Kubernetes cluster contains six main components:

API server: Exposes a REST interface to all Kubernetes resources. Serves as the front end of the Kubernetes control plane.

Scheduler: Places containers according to resource requirements and metrics. Makes note of Pods with no assigned node, and selects nodes for them to run on.

Controller manager: Runs controller processes and reconciles the cluster’s actual state with its desired specifications. Manages controllers such as node controllers, endpoints controllers and replication controllers.

Kubelet: Ensures that containers are running in a Pod by interacting with the Docker engine , the default program for creating and managing containers. Takes a set of provided PodSpecs and ensures that their corresponding containers are fully operational.

Kube-proxy: Manages network connectivity and maintains network rules across nodes. Implements the Kubernetes Service concept across every node in a given cluster.

Etcd: Stores all cluster data. Consistent and highly available Kubernetes backing store. 

These six components can each run on Linux or as Docker containers. The master node runs the API server, scheduler and controller manager, and the worker nodes run the kubelet and kube-proxy.
